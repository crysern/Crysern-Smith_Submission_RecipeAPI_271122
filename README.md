The final project for the course is to build your own REST service (API).

**Goals**

The API should support basic CRUD operations and allow a user to:

● Create a new recipe

● Read (retrieve) all existing recipes

● Update a recipe

● Delete a recipe

Data will be stored locally (not persisted to a database so will disappear when the
application stops running).

What we expect to see:

● Use of JSON objects

● Use of relevant HTTP protocols - GET, POST, PUT, DELETE

● Local memory storage (Java collections)

● A recipe should have:

○ ID

○ Name

○ Ingredients

■ Name

■ Quantity

○ Instructions

○ Image (optional)

● Use of testing - as you learn TDD, you should add tests to your project
